For folks who want to have a thorough walk through can watch the video linked below:-


Package Installation and Configuration setup
First open pubspec.yaml file and add package image_picker: ^0.8.3 . This is the package that will provide us with methods to access our gallery and camera.
Now, once the package is installed, we would need to make some changes to our an iOS and Android config files. For this article purpose, I am using iOS simulator.
Add the following keys to your Info.plist file, located in <project root>/ios/Runner/Info.plist:

NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription - describe why your app needs permission for the photo library. This is called Privacy - Photo Library Usage Description in the visual editor.
NSCameraUsageDescription - describe why your app needs access to the camera. This is called Privacy - Camera Usage Description in the visual editor.
UI and Coding
Now, that our dependencies and configurations are set, let’s jump onto coding part.

Firstly for this demo, I will just create two basic buttons, one for Gallery and another for camera. Copy and paste the below code.

@override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text("Image Picker Example"),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          children: [
            MaterialButton(
                color: Colors.blue,
                child: const Text(
                    "Pick Image from Gallery",
                  style: TextStyle(
                    color: Colors.white70, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold
                  )
                ),
                onPressed: () {
                }
            ),
            MaterialButton(
                color: Colors.blue,
                child: const Text(
                    "Pick Image from Camera",
                    style: TextStyle(
                        color: Colors.white70, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold
                    )
                ),
                onPressed: () {
                }
            ),
          ],
        ),
      )
    );
  }
